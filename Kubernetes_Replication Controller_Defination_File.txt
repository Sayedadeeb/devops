+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ REPLICATION CONTROLLER DEFINITION FILE ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ReplicationController:
This is an high level object used for handling multiple replicas of a specific pod. Here we can perform load balancing and scalling.
ReplicationController uses keys like replicas, template" etc in the "spec" section.
In template section we can give metadata related to the pod and also use another spec section where we can give containers information.





Ex: Create  a replication controller for creating 3 replicas of httpd


$ vim  replication-controller.yml
